            <p class="big">With 20 years of experience pioneering cloud and developer tools, Jeff has been a major influence in defining the modern world of software development.</p>
            <p>He coined and popularized webhooks while envisioning serverless and "no-code" 10 years ahead of mass adoption. At NASA Ames, he worked on what became OpenStack. As an early engineer at Twilio, he helped build out their platform engineering team. </p>
            <p>He also helped design and kickstart the Docker project, then created Dokku, an open-source single-host Heroku that was also the first killer app for Docker. He's built many other novel open-source projects including localtunnel, which inspired Ngrok among others.

                        <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) isn't just a new take on "write once, run anywhere." Creative use of WebAssembly enables new possibilities in browsers, in the cloud, and beyond. We are particularly excited about using it to make products more programmable and extensible by users.

We also love to build entirely new, standalone tools using VSCode as a foundation, saving development time while providing a familiar UX.

                    <h3>Apptron</h3>
                    <p>Apptron is a full development environment like Codespaces or Gitpod that runs entirely in the browser without any cloud compute resources. Using VSCode, Wanix, and other open-source primitives we've pioneered, Apptron is also a fully malleable environment that can be molded into more specialized tools.

                    <p>Manifold is a revolutionary new way to build software systems that is more accessible and productive than just writing code, while maintaining the performance and capabilities of working with a powerful systems language. Systems built with Manifold are more flexible by default, while being faster and more enjoyable to build than traditional approaches.

                    <p>Wanix is an experimental WebAssembly-native operating system. Inspired by Unix and Plan 9, Wanix can run natively or in the browser to power portable, sandboxed development environments like Apptron.
